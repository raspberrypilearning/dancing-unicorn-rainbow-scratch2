## Introduction

Create an LED rainbow and make a unicorn dance to it, all powered by the Raspberry Pi.

### What you will make

You will use Scratch to connect a rainbow of LEDs to a unicorn sprite, and then make the unicorn dance to the rhythm of the rainbow. Here is a video showing what your dancing unicorn and rainbow might look like:

<video width="560" height="315" controls>
<source src="resources/Screencast.mp4" type="video/mp4">

Once you have trained your unicorn to dance to your rainbow, you can learn how to use the rainbow to make the unicorn do tricks or play a game.
