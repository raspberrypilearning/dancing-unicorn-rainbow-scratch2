## Buzzer challenge

Your challenge is to replace one of the LEDs with a buzzer noise!

+ Connect a buzzer to your Raspberry Pi.

Follow the instructions below to connect this new component. The instructions tell you to use **GPIO 17**, but because you already have LEDs and a button, you can place your buzzer wherever there is room, and use any free GPIO pin.

+ Code your buzzer so that it buzzes instead of one of your LEDs lighting up.

Follow the instructions below to create code for your buzzer. Adapt the instructions to use the buzzer's GPIO pin, and make sure your new code fits into the program you already have.
