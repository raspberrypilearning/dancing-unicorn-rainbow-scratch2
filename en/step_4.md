## Your rainbow's first colour

You will now light up the rainbow's first colour with an LED. Choose any colour you wish, but here we've gone with the red colour of the rainbow spectrum (red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, violet).

+ Create a circuit to connect your LED to the Raspberry Pi. Your circuit will light up the rainbow's first colour.

If you have never connected an LED before, click below for information about LED circuits, and for detailed instructions.
